/*
 * kernel/user.c -- AArch64 EL0 userspace, first cut
 * =================================================
 *
 * What this file is
 * -----------------
 * The minimum machinery to get a thread running at EL0 (user mode)
 * and back into the kernel via SVC.  Once it works, ksh + future
 * processes can move "out of the kernel" -- but for this first cut
 * we just want to prove the boundary itself.
 *
 * Outline
 * -------
 *
 *   user_init()                              (from kmain, after mmu_init)
 *       |
 *       v
 *   copy user_program + user_msg into user_storage (kernel-VA write)
 *   ic iallu + dsb + isb                     (instructions become visible)
 *   mmu_map_user_2mb(USER_VA, &user_storage) (publish to EL0)
 *
 *   user_spawn()                             (creates a kthread)
 *       |
 *       v  (when the scheduler picks the thread)
 *   user_thread_main()
 *       |
 *       v
 *   aarch64_enter_userspace(entry, sp_el0)
 *       msr SP_EL0, ELR_EL1, SPSR_EL1
 *       eret -> EL0 at user code
 *
 *   user code (running in EL0):
 *       mov x0, #msg_addr      ; pointer into user page
 *       mov x8, #SYS_log
 *       svc #0                  ; trap to EL1
 *   kernel:
 *       vectors.S VEC_SYNC_LO64 entry (offset 0x400)
 *       trap_dispatch, ESR.EC=0x15  (SVC from AArch64 lower EL)
 *       syscall_dispatch -> sys_log
 *       kprintf reads the user pointer (same TTBR0)
 *       eret -> back to EL0 next instruction (b .)
 *   user code: spins forever in EL0
 *
 * Backing storage and address spaces
 * ----------------------------------
 * We have one TTBR0 with kernel + user mappings co-resident; the
 * AP[2:1]=01 bit on the user 2 MB block is what makes it accessible
 * from EL0.  No TTBR1 split yet, no per-process page tables.
 *
 * user_storage is a 2 MB-aligned BSS region; mmu_map_user_2mb
 * remaps VA 0x10000000..0x10200000 to user_storage's PA with user
 * permissions, so the EL0 view at VA 0x10000000 == user_storage's
 * kernel-VA contents.
 *
 * Cache maintenance
 * -----------------
 * We just wrote bytes to user_storage as DATA.  The CPU's I-cache
 * has no entries for that PA yet, but it WILL fetch and cache once
 * EL0 starts executing.  To make sure the I-cache pulls our fresh
 * bytes (and not whatever happened to be in cache from before),
 * we do an IC IALLU + DSB ISH + ISB after the writes.  Heavy-handed
 * vs. per-VA IC IVAU but trivially correct for this scale.
